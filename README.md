# mean-stack-socialnetwork

This is a small side project I'm working on where I'm building a social media messenger-like application utilizing the MEAN stack with Angular 2. 

The program functions as a message board where one can: Sign Up, Sign In and posts messages to the message board.

1.) Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

2.) Run `npm start` in your CLI. 

3.) Run `npm run build` to run the development build script => Keep this process running! It recompiles your files upon changes.

4.) Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser of choice to view the latest copy of the project.
