# mean-stack-project

This is a small side project I'm working on where I'm building a social media messenger-like application utilizing the MEAN stack with Angular 2. 

1.) Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

2.) Run `npm start` in your CLI. 

3.) Run `npm run build` to run the development build script => Keep this process running! It recompiles your files upon changes.

4) Run `npm start` in a new command line/ terminal window => Keep this process running as well, it's your NodeJS server. 

5.) Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser of choice to view the latest copy of the project.
