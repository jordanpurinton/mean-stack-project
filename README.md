# mean-stack-project

This is a small side project I'm working on where I'm building a messenger-like application utilizing the MEAN stack with Angular 2. 

Clone into the repo and run `npm start` in your CLI. 

Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser of choice to view the latest copy of my project.
